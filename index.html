        in the province of Varese in Lombardy.
        He was an Italian footballer and sports manager , who played as a forward. After starting out in the ranks of
        Legnano , he then tied the rest of his competitive career to Cagliari,wearing the shirt from 1963 to 1977 and
        still holding the scoring record with 208 goals. In the 1969-70 season he contributed significantly to the
        victory of the first and only Cagliari championship , also becoming the tournament's top scorer on that
        occasion. Remaining linked to the Sardinian team even after his retirement, he briefly assumed the highest
        position in the 1986-87 season; from 2019 until his death he held the position of honorary
        president.<br></br>With the Italian national team , of which he is the top scorer with 35 goals scored in 42
        appearances, he won the European Championship in 1968 and finished second at the 1970 World Cup . From 1990 to
        2013 he was the team manager . Gigi Riva died at the age of 79 on Monday 22 January from heart problems. The
        legendary Cagliari and national team striker had been admitted to hospital for an illness and in the following
        hours refused an angioplasty.

      <ul class="carrer-list">
        <li>
          <p class="carrer-date">1962-1963</p>
          <p class="carrer-info line-height">He played at Legnano, first in the youth team and then promoted to the
            first team squad, in Serie C
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="carrer-date">1963-1964</p>
          <p class="carrer-info line-height">He was noticed and bought by Cagliari for 37 million lire to play in the
            1963-64 Serie B championship. He scored his first goal on the first day and scored a total of eight during
            the championship.
          </p>
        <li>
          <p class="carrer-date">1965-1969</p>
          <p class="carrer-info line-height">After being promoted to Serie A, still with Cagliari, he scored his first
            goal in the championship on 27 September 1964, becoming the team's mainstay from that moment on, and, for
            the first time, becoming top scorer in the 1966-67 Serie A championship with 18 goals. In 1965 he was called
            up for the Italian national team for the first time and made his debut on 27 June 1965. With the Italian
            national team he became European champion in 1968, scoring 7 goals. During these years, he was nicknamed <i
              class="marker">"Rombo di Tuono"</i> by journalist Gianni Brera for his remarkable shooting power and
            prolificacy at the net.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="carrer-date">1969-1970</p>
          <p class="carrer-info line-height">He also triumphed in the goalscoring charts in the 1968-69 and 1969-70
            seasons. In the latter season he was the absolute protagonist of the ride that led Cagliari to <i
              class="marker">victory in the championship </i>(the only one in the history of Sardinia). On 12 April
            1970, in the match against Bari that awarded the tricolour, he scored the first of two goals. The title
            victory represented the highest point of Riva's career, who in the meantime had become a symbol of Cagliari
            and Sardinia not only from a sporting point of view, but also from a social and media one. In the four-year
            period 1967-70, his golden period with the Azzurri, he scored 21 goals in 22 matches between official and
            friendly matches, establishing himself as one of the most prolific strikers of his generation.

        <li>
          <p class="carrer-date">1971-1976</p>
          <p class="carrer-info line-height">He played at high levels the following seasons 1972-73 (12 goals) and
            1973-74 (15 goals), but for Cagliari, by then far from the Scudetto-fighting, the downward parabola was
            beginning. In 1969 Riva came second in France Football's Golden Ball classification, behind Gianni Rivera,
            by 4 points,[54] and in 1970 he was third behind Gerd Müller and Bobby Moore, who preceded him by 12 and 4
            points respectively. In two other editions he received votes and entered the final classification: in 1967
            he finished thirteenth with 6 votes and in 1968 sixth, 39 votes behind the winner George Best. He played
            with Cagliari until the end of the 1975-76 championship. The last years of his career were characterised by
            consistently high scoring averages and new injuries that almost entirely compromised the 1974-75
            championship, in which he played only 8 matches and scored just 2 goals. In October 1976, when he was still
            officially a player in the red and blue squad, he founded the <i class="marker">‘Centro Sportivo Gigi
              Riva’</i>, the first football school in Sardinia, still active today.

          <p class="carrer-date">1977-1986</p>
          <p class="carrer-info line-height">When his competitive career was over, he joined the staff of the red-blue
            team, then in their second year of Serie B, as second coach in the 1977-78 season.
            From 1979, while holding a coaching licence, he became to all intents and purposes an executive of the club,
            with the role of first-team manager, acting in practice as a trait d'union between the dressing room and the
            top management.
            In December 1985, he took over as president and left the position until December 1986, saying goodbye to
            Cagliari after 24 years as a player and manager.
